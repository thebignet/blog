    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2012 I started looking at the effusion of JS frameworks, amongst which three cought my attention :
&ndash; <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>
&ndash; <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a>
&ndash; <a href="angularjs.org">AngularJS</a></p>

<p>At that time, <strong>AngularJS</strong> was still emerging compared to Backbone, which was used in production and had all the attention.  Backbone is simple, so simple that its code serves as documentation.  This seems like a good thing, but the purpose of a framework is not to be designed simply, but to be simple to use.  That&rsquo;s what Knockout.js and AngularJS are.  But between the two, Knockout.js is too limited.  It does very well with data binding and templating, but doesn&rsquo;t have advanced features that made the popularity of AngularJS such as dependency injection, services, directives, animations &hellip;</p>

<p>AngularJS is my prefered choice for future web applications.  It does wonders with a backend thanks to its REST API.  For me there&rsquo;s no need to have server-side rendering as AngularJS can take care of it and make use of services to communicate to the server.</p>
