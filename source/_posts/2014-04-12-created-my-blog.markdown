My name is Jean Detoeuf.  I live in Lyon and I'm a software developer.  I spent the last few years learning to code and have gotten quite good at it.  Can't say I'm a genius, but I get my way around a few design patterns.  I can't remember their names, but that's not really the point of design patterns.  They're meant as good practice for programmers.

This blog will be about the Java ecosystem, Agility, and the software industry.  Hope you'll enjoy reading it.  I'll be linking a lot of things I find useful and sometimes be posting solutions to problems I've come accross that weren't already on the web.
