In 2012 I started looking at the effusion of JS frameworks, amongst which three cought my attention :
- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
- [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)
- [AngularJS](angularjs.org)

At that time, **AngularJS** was still emerging compared to Backbone, which was used in production and had all the attention.  Backbone is simple, so simple that its code serves as documentation.  This seems like a good thing, but the purpose of a framework is not to be designed simply, but to be simple to use.  That's what Knockout.js and AngularJS are.  But between the two, Knockout.js is too limited.  It does very well with data binding and templating, but doesn't have advanced features that made the popularity of AngularJS such as dependency injection, services, directives, animations ...

AngularJS is my prefered choice for future web applications.  It does wonders with a backend thanks to its REST API.  For me there's no need to have server-side rendering as AngularJS can take care of it and make use of services to communicate to the server.
