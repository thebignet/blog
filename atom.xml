    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2012 I started looking at the effusion of JS frameworks, amongst which three cought my attention :
&ndash; <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>
&ndash; <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a>
&ndash; <a href="angularjs.org">AngularJS</a></p>

<p>At that time, <strong>AngularJS</strong> was still emerging compared to Backbone, which was used in production and had all the attention.  Backbone is simple, so simple that its code serves as documentation.  This seems like a good thing, but the purpose of a framework is not to be designed simply, but to be simple to use.  That&rsquo;s what Knockout.js and AngularJS are.  But between the two, Knockout.js is too limited.  It does very well with data binding and templating, but doesn&rsquo;t have advanced features that made the popularity of AngularJS such as dependency injection, services, directives, animations &hellip;</p>

<p>AngularJS is my prefered choice for future web applications.  It does wonders with a backend thanks to its REST API.  For me there&rsquo;s no need to have server-side rendering as AngularJS can take care of it and make use of services to communicate to the server.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it isn&rsquo;t really my first pull request.  I&rsquo;ve done pull request on friend&rsquo;s projects on GitHub or even on GitLab working in corporate environment.  This was really my first pull request on an open source project.  Ever since I saw Zack Holman&rsquo;s <a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/product-is-the-byproduct/">presentation</a> at Mix-It 2013 I knew I had to be a part of it.  And there I am contributing to Pivotal&rsquo;s <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> project.</p>

<p>I made this change because I was using Spring Boot for a corporate project.  The bootstrapping made it really easy to build, the convention over configuration aspect had the advantage of reducing the amount of overhead code to get the app up and running.  But maybe the convention wasn&rsquo;t fully what I needed.  Spring Boot 1.0.0.RELEASE had support for ActiveMQ, which worked great, but in my company, where the queuing system was relatively new, they decided to secure it by adding credentials.  Unfortunatly, Spring Boot did not provide out-of-the-box support for credentials.</p>

<p>Adding this functionality was terribly easy (35 lines added and 4 removed).  I had modified the Spring Boot project I had cloned and builded it and deployed it as SNAPSHOT on my local repository.  Everything worked on first try.  As this is a common feature I guessed I wouldn&rsquo;t be the first and last to want it.  I commited this feature on a new branch on my GitHub fork and made a <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/618">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>The Spring Boot team was really quick as to check the pull request and accepted it after my signing Pivotal&rsquo;s legal papers.  It got integrated into Spring Boot 1.0.1.RELEASE.</p>

<p>This may seem as not a big deal to many readers, but I&rsquo;m sure you had the same excitement on your first major pull request.</p>

<p>I am now a part of the open source community.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Jean Detoeuf.  I live in Lyon and I&rsquo;m a software developer.  I spent the last few years learning to code and have gotten quite good at it.  Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a genius, but I get my way around a few design patterns.  I can&rsquo;t remember their names, but that&rsquo;s not really the point of design patterns.  They&rsquo;re meant as good practice for programmers.</p>

<p>This blog will be about the Java ecosystem, Agility, and the software industry.  Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy reading it.  I&rsquo;ll be linking a lot of things I find useful and sometimes be posting solutions to problems I&rsquo;ve come accross that weren&rsquo;t already on the web.</p>
